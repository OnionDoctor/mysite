##### Biography

**Xincong YANG** (杨新聪) is an assistant professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html), teaching courses related to Construction Technology, Digital Construction I - Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Digital Construction II - Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT).

Dr. Yang earned his PhD in Construction Informatics and Structural Engineering from [Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) and [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), respectively. Before joining HITSZ, he was also a postoral fellow in the [Smart Construction Lab](https://www.sclab.hk/) at PolyU.

His reseach focuses on Smart Construction and Intelligent Maintenance and Operation, specially detecting multiple exterior wall defects from multimodal resources through computer vision and deep learning techniques, and multifunctional digital twin at building, community and city scales through collective intelligence and UAV-UGV integration. He is currently working on reserach projects on space-air-surface monitoring of existing buildings and low-carbon digital twin models.
